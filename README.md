# Design and Validation of BlockEval, a Blockchain Simulator

In this repository, we introduce the design and architecture of our
blockchain simulator, BlockEval, which mimics the behaviour
of concurrent operations that occur in a real-life blockchain
system.

BlockEval can be extended to simulate any blockchain framework. In 
the provided implementation, we show the Proof-of-Work implementation
of BlockEval.

We use Python (3.7+) and Simpy, a popular process-based
discrete-event simulation framework developed in standard
Python to implement the simulator.
